# Spyfall


# What is it?

[Spyfall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spyfall_(card_game)) is a party game where every player besides 1, the Spy, is given the same location. 

The game proceeds with players asking each other questions in whatever order they like, trying to figure out who knows the location and who is the Spy. 

The Spy is trying to blend in with the rest of the players while trying to determine what location all the other players are in.
